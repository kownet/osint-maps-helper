Bounding Box Helper
====================

It is a simple web project which aim is to help get coordinates of the selected place.

To use it we have to draw a rectangle on the map and next in the top right corner we will see a [bounding box](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bounding_Box) coordinates.

With this kind of data we can for example:

1. Use [Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview) to catch tweets from specific [geographical location](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/request-parameters#locations).
2. Use [Instagram API](https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/locations/) to catch photos from specific geographical location.
3. Use [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) to catch movies from specific geographical location.
